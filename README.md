Project Name: Comparing SAT Encodings of Constraint Problems

Description: Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) models problems using Boolean variables and propositional logic clauses. Its simplicity makes it applicable to many problems from industry and mathematics, and has enabled the creation of very efficient solvers which can be downloaded free from the Web. There are several ways of modelling (encoding) a problem as SAT. In this project we will choose some constraint satisfaction problems, encode them in different ways (some standard and some little-known), and compare their effectiveness using at least one solver. This project would suit a student who is interested in artificial intelligence. Little mathematical knowledge is needed but a logical mind and reasonable programming skills are important. It would suit a 4th year or MSc student, and in the latter case more encodings and problems should be compared.

Solvers: Minisat

Constraint Problems: Knight Tour, Sudoku
